Quokkas are described as the happiest animal in the world since they are always smiling. 
Many tourists visit the Rottnest Island to see quokkas and take selfies with them.


In our animation, we describe the secret of this one quokka who is tired of taking selfies and smiling for people- all he wants is food.
