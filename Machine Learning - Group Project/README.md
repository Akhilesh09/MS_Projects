# Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

Description:
The following models are implemented to classify a program as Benign or Malicious:
  Decision Tree
  Perceptron
  Ensemble Model
    Weak Learners - Decision Trees
    Outputs from the Decision Trees are used to train a Perceptron
  Neural Network
  Novel Model
    Weak Learners - Decision Trees
    Outputs from the Decision Trees are used to train a Deep Neural Network
